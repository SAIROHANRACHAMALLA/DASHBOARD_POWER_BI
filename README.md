#SALES  INSIGHTS OF ATLIQ HARDWARE COMPANY USING DASHBOARD CREATED BY POWER BI .  

PROBLEM STATEMENT : CEO of Atliq computer manufacturing company want to know the insights of his company sales in India. So when he enquire about the sales throught his regional managers he was given some figures .Overall all sales were decreasing when he compare the data shared by his managers and actual company revenue. He was unable to getting exact analysis of sales. 

SOLUTION : In this project I have developed a dashboard using power bi which helps the CEO and regional managers to know the trace of their sales , revenue , regional wise sales etc. I used the data which contains the different useful details like sales quantity ,transactions , markets,products , customers etc of atliq hardware comapny in the time between 2017 to 2020.

Steps followed by me in this project :

1) Understanding the problem statement.Here the problem is to know the insights of sales of atlique manufacturer company.
2) Collecting the relavent data to solve the problem . In this project I have collected the data from sales management system which generally prints invoice when one buy the products.
3) Data cleaning : Removing irrelavent data from the collected data. I have removed data related to the market zone like Newyork , paris because we want to analyze the sales of atliq in India.
4) Analyzing the data. I have analyzed the data using Power Bi. In my dashboard I have analyzed the trend between revenue , sales quantity in different market zone in different years. Also revenue trend with year.
5) Feedback from my friends : Before completion of final dashboard I have show my dashboard to my friends in the intial stages and took their feedback in  terms of visual appearance and modified my dashboard.
6) Crosschecking the data of dashboard. I have used mysql to cross check whether  data from my dashboard is correct or not .

So finally I have created a dashboard which helps the CEO of atliq hardware and the regional managers to know their revenue trend by one click.

"A picture is worth a thousand words ". So data visualization of relavent data helps one analyze hidden insights of the data.
